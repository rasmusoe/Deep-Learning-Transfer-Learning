# CVML Kaggle Challenge
Source code the in-class kaggle challenge for the course in Computer Vision and Machine Learning

## Models
Support Vector Machine (SVM): support for linear and traditional kernels (rbf, poly, sigmoid)

Fully-Connected Neural Network (FC): implements a dense (fully-connected) neural network with a softmax classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): traditional knn classifier

Naive Bayes (Bayes): implements a Gaussian naive bayes classifier

## Usage
The Training/ directory contains scripts for generating, training and evaluating the models. Each script takes an output directory as an argument, in which it will place all output files. The trained models can be configured by changing the paramneters within the training scripts.
